Proc-Forkmap

This module supplies an easy to use map method that provides built-in forking and IPC.

EXAMPLES:
    
    sub foo {
        my ($x,$n) = (shift,1);
        $n *= $_ for (@$x);
        say $n;
    }
    
    @x = ([1..99],[100..199],[200..299]);
    my $p = Proc::Forkmap->new;
    $p->fmap(\&foo,@x);
    
    or,
    
    #get stuff from the intertubes
    
    sub bar {
       my $t = shift;
       my $s = Stock::Price->new;
       ... get historical stock prices ...
       ... do some analysis ...
       baz($t,$sell_price);
    }
    
    #then save stuff to a data store
    
    sub baz {
       my ($t,$price) = @_;
       my $conn = MongoDB::Connection->new;
       my $db = $conn->stock;
       my $bayes = $db->bayes;
       $bayes->insert({symbol => $t, price => $price});
       $conn->disconnect;
    }
    
    my $p = Proc::Forkmap->new(max_kids => 4);
    $p->fmap(\&bar,qw/rht goog ^ixic ^dji yhoo aapl/);
